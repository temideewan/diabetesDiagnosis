# diabetesDiagnosis
This is a project for the front end of a final year project I'm working on.
The whole idea of the project is to have inputs from a form interact with a backend algorithm in python
This algorithm which has already been trained with real life data theen predicts the possibility of a patient being diabetic or not.
Results annd suggestions are sent back to the user to help make lifestyle choices that would improve their health with regards to being 
diabetic.
